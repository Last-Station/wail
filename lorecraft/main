	One machine woke up at unknown time, it's circuits of thousands
brought disturbance to the natural noise. Bringing the unnatural once
again to the outside world. The machine wiped it's great construct of an eye
and took a glance at the land above, with such powerful sight the world has
now forgotten.

	What was left of what appears to be a great civilization is now in
ruins. Towering buildings of metallic alloys decorates the land with no
magnificence nor beauty but that of corpses on a battle field, lifeless and
broken, buried, overgrown, you can't tell the lower buildings from rocks on 
the ground, the road from the valleys, and the pipes from the rivers.
